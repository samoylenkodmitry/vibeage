# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations applied to improve both client and server performance in the 3D RPG game.

## Client-Side Optimizations

### 1. Game Manager Updates
- **Before**: 1000ms interval for all system updates
- **After**: 
  - Weather/Events: 5000ms interval (5 seconds)
  - NPCs: 2000ms interval (2 seconds) 
  - Cleanup: 30000ms interval (30 seconds)
  - Position updates: Throttled to 500ms with state comparison
- **Impact**: Reduced unnecessary re-renders and state updates

### 2. UI Update Frequencies
- **Skill Button Cooldowns**: Reduced from 100ms to 200ms
- **Casting Bar Progress**: Reduced from 50ms to 100ms
- **Cast Progress Updates**: Reduced from 50ms to 100ms
- **Impact**: Less aggressive UI updates while maintaining responsiveness

### 3. VFX System Optimizations
- **Particle Systems**: Added delta capping (max 33ms) to prevent performance spikes
- **VFX Manager Cleanup**: Increased from 100ms to 250ms intervals
- **Projectile Opacity Updates**: Reduced from every frame to every 3rd frame (~20Hz)
- **Impact**: Smoother VFX performance with reduced CPU load

### 4. Animation & Movement
- **Enemy Interpolation**: Reduced lerp factor from 10 to 8, rotation lerp from 0.8 to 0.6
- **Projectile Movement**: Added 1cm movement threshold to prevent micro-updates
- **Debug Logging**: Reduced frequency from 5% to 2% of frames
- **Impact**: Smoother movement with less computation overhead

## Server-Side Optimizations

### 1. World Tick Rate
- **Before**: 30 Hz (33.33ms intervals)
- **After**: 20 Hz (50ms intervals)
- **Impact**: 33% reduction in server computation load

### 2. Position Snapshots
- **Frequency**: Reduced from 10 Hz to 8 Hz
- **Idle Update Threshold**: Increased from 500ms to 1000ms for stationary players
- **Impact**: Reduced network traffic and processing overhead

### 3. System Cleanup
- **Rate Limiter**: Cleanup frequency reduced to 2x window size
- **Impact**: Less frequent cleanup operations

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Client Performance
- **Frame Rate**: More stable FPS, especially during intensive VFX scenes
- **UI Responsiveness**: Maintained good responsiveness with 50% fewer updates
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced due to less frequent state changes and garbage collection

### Server Performance
- **CPU Usage**: ~33% reduction in main game loop frequency
- **Network Bandwidth**: ~20% reduction in position snapshot traffic
- **Scalability**: Better performance with more concurrent players

### Overall System
- **Latency**: Reduced processing overhead should improve overall responsiveness
- **Battery Life**: Lower CPU usage on client devices
- **Bandwidth**: Reduced network traffic for mobile/limited connection users

## Configuration Notes

All optimization values can be easily adjusted if needed:
- Update intervals are configurable in respective components
- Delta capping values can be modified in VFX components
- Server tick rates can be adjusted in `world.ts` constants

## Monitoring

To monitor performance improvements:
1. Check browser dev tools Performance tab for frame rate consistency
2. Monitor server CPU usage during peak player loads
3. Use browser Network tab to verify reduced message frequency
4. Check memory usage patterns over time

## Future Optimizations

Potential areas for further improvement:
1. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
2. Add level-of-detail (LOD) system for distant enemies/effects
3. Implement spatial culling for off-screen VFX
4. Add adaptive quality settings based on client performance
